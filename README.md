TOPIC: Walmart Weekly Sales Prediction
Introduction
Walmart is one of the leading retail stores in the US. They use data to drive their day to day business objective. The following dataset that has been used in this project lists about the weekly sales at Walmart with respect to other conditions that might effect the weekly sales. I found this dataset particularly interesting because of the practical nature of the problem.

Business Problem
Walmart, would like to predict the sales and demand accurately so that they can be prepared with the right stocks and other arrangements to maximise on the sales. There are certain events and holidays which impact sales on each day. There are sales data available for 45 stores of Walmart. The business is facing a challenge due to unforeseen demands and runs out of stock some times. Walmart runs several promotional markdown events throughout the year mainly preceding prominent holidays. The objective of this project is to derive valuable information out of the data like which holidays and events are likely to impact on sales, understanding the effects of external factors like fuel price, temperature, unemployment on sales. And ultimate objective isto predict the Weekly Sales amount using machine learning models and deploy the models on a test data which will drive the decision making at Walmart.
