# TOPIC: Walmart Weekly Sales Prediction
# Introduction
Walmart is one of the leading retail stores in the US. They use data to drive their day-to-day business objective. The following dataset that has been used in this project lists the weekly sales at Walmart with respect to other conditions that might affect the weekly sales. I found this dataset particularly interesting because of the practical nature of the problem.

# Business Problem
Walmart would like to predict the sales and demand accurately so that they can be prepared with the right stocks and other arrangements to maximize sales. There are certain events and holidays which impact sales on each day. There are sales data available for 45 stores of Walmart. The business is facing a challenge due to unforeseen demands and runs out of stock sometimes. Walmart runs several promotional markdown events throughout the year mainly preceding prominent holidays. The objective of this project is to derive valuable information from the data like which holidays and events are likely to impact sales and understand the effects of external factors like fuel price, temperature, and unemployment on sales. And ultimate objective is to predict the Weekly Sales amount using machine learning models and deploy the models on test data which will drive the decision-making at Walmart.
